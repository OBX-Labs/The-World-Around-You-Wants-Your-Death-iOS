Are there supposed to be sharks in the ocean? he asks.
Once again, I don't feel up to the task
Of living and dying 
Of failing and trying
To tell a story that's fit for the telling.
To tell the story without outright lying.

How do you say
The world that surrounds you wants your death
And every day
The sharks, they are swimmin'
Looking for women
and children like you, out of breath.

Are there supposed to be sharks in the ocean? he asks.
Because there are!
There are.
